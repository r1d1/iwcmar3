<h1 id="proposal-3rd-international-workshop-on-computational-models-of-affordance-in-robotics">[Proposal]<br />3rd International Workshop on<br />Computational Models of Affordance in Robotics</h1>
<h3 id="may-or-04-june-2020-icra-2020-paris-france">31 May or 04 June 2020, ICRA 2020, Paris, France</h3>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Affordance is one of the key concepts that might enable an autonomous agent to interact with a variety of novel objects successfully. The concept was coined by the psychologist James J. Gibson, nonetheless, many others in his field have re-defined it in an attempt to generalise it to different contextualisations.
When transferring the affordance concept to robotics, we find a wide range of methodologies that propose new formalisms based on different psychology theories. However, there are many open issues that jeopardise the basis of the affordance research such as: is the internal representation or direct perception the best way to represent affordance in robotics? What are the key elements of the robotics affordance process? How do we evaluate these processes? Is there a dataset to evaluate affordances and if not, what is the best course of action to collect it?</p>
<p>Accordingly, the aim of this workshop is threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>To review the clear concept gap between affordance theory in psychology and its application in robotics through an overview of state-of-the-art literature in the research of affordance.</li>
<li>To discuss the evaluation standards for the different affordace tasks.</li>
<li>To agree on a methodology to follow to collect a dataset that serves as standard to evaluate affordance methodologies.</li>
